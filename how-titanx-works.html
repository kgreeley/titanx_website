        <h1>How TitanX Works</h1>
        <p>TitanX is a revolutionary cryptocurrency designed to create value through scarcity and innovative mechanisms. Here's how it works:</p>
        
        <h2>Massive Buy & Burn Pressure</h2>
        <p>TitanX utilizes small liquidity pools combined with constant buy & burn mechanisms. This approach systematically reduces the available supply over time, potentially increasing the value of remaining tokens.</p>

        <h2>Large Portion of Supply Staked</h2>
        <p>Users can earn substantial ETH yield by locking up their TitanX coins. This staking mechanism further reduces the circulating supply, contributing to scarcity.</p>

        <h2>Proof of Burn 2.0</h2>
        <p>TitanX introduces an innovative concept where developers can use TitanX to launch their own tokens. This process permanently burns TitanX out of existence, continually decreasing the total supply.</p>

        <h2>Daily Reductions</h2>
        <p>The amount of TitanX that can be mined is reduced on a daily basis. This makes it progressively harder and more expensive to produce new tokens over time, potentially increasing scarcity and value.</p>

        <h2>Leverage on ETH Value</h2>
        <p>TitanX is directly tied to ETH, meaning that as ETH becomes more valuable, so does TitanX. This creates a symbiotic relationship between the two cryptocurrencies.</p>

        <p>By combining these mechanisms, TitanX aims to create a self-sustaining ecosystem that continually drives value through scarcity and demand. Join the TitanX community today to be part of this innovative cryptocurrency project!</p>
